            A garage box in The Hague is where the adventure began in 2008,
            with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles. The garage box soon became too small after which they moved
            to a shed on an industrial estate.
            Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be moved to an empty
            Ministry of Agriculture.
            When this building too had to be vacated, the then collection of 10 arcade video games with some
            spare parts was stored in an old classic car showroom.
            Since there was no room there to renovate or play the cabinets, suitable space was sought out
        </p>
        <p>
            That was found in 2011 at the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer.
            There Hasan decided to rent the location with 4 friends and the adventure could grow into
            their own meeting place to practice their hobby and relax with a game.
